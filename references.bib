  abstract = {Abstract             Counts data with excessive zeros are frequently encountered in practice. For example, the number of health services visits often includes many zeros representing the patients with no utilization during a follow-up time. A common feature of this type of data is that the count measure tends to have excessive zero beyond a common count distribution can accommodate, such as Poisson or negative binomial. Zero-inflated or hurdle models are often used to fit such data. Despite the increasing popularity of ZI and hurdle models, there is still a lack of investigation of the fundamental differences between these two types of models. In this article, we reviewed the zero-inflated and hurdle models and highlighted their differences in terms of their data generating processes. We also conducted simulation studies to evaluate the performances of both types of models. The final choice of regression model should be made after a careful assessment of goodness of fit and should be tailored to a particular data in question.},

  abstract = {Non‐Bayesian inference regarding a parameter of interest in the presence of a nuisance parameter may be based on the integrated likelihood function, in which the nuisance parameter is eliminated by averaging the likelihood function with respect to a weight function for the nuisance parameter. Recent research has shown that integrated likelihood methods work particularly well when the model is reparameterized in terms of a nuisance parameter chosen to be “unrelated” to the parameter of interest and the corresponding weight function for this nuisance parameter is chosen so that it does not depend on the parameter of interest. One choice for such a nuisance parameter is the               zero score expectation (ZSE)               parameter. The purpose of this note is to extend the definition of the ZSE parameter to the case in which the model has a parameter vector                                θ                              , with the parameter of interest of the model taken to be a function of                                θ                              ; that is, the definition of the ZSE parameter is extended to the case in which there is not an explicit nuisance parameter for the model. The resulting integrated likelihood function has the same desirable properties as integrated likelihoods based on the ZSE parameter in models with an explicit nuisance parameter.},
