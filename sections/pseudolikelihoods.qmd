## Pseudolikelihoods {#sec-pseudolikelihoods}

Let $\Theta \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n_+$ represent the space of possible values for $\theta$ and suppose we have a real-valued *parameter of interest* $\psi = \tau(\theta)$, where $\tau: \Theta \to \Psi$ is a known function with at least two continuous derivatives. Though it is not strictly necessary, in order to align with the tendency of researchers to focus on one-dimensional summaries of vector quantities we will assume for our purposes that $\psi$ is a scalar, i.e. $\Psi \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

This reduced dimension of $\Psi$ relative to $\Theta$ implies the existence of a *nuisance parameter* $\lambda \in \Lambda \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. As its name suggests, $\lambda$ tends to obfuscate or outright preclude inference regarding $\psi$ and typically must be eliminated from the likelihood before proceeding. The product of this elimination is called a *pseudolikelihood function*. Any function of the data and $\psi$ alone could theoretically be considered a pseudolikelihood, though  course in practice some are more useful than others. 
If we let $\Theta_{\psi} = \{\theta \in \Theta: \> \tau(\theta) = \psi \},$ then associated with each $\psi \in \Psi$ is the set of likelihood values $\mathcal{L}_{\psi} = \{L(\theta): \> \theta \in \Theta_{\psi}\}.$ For a given value of $\psi$, there may exist multiple corresponding values of $\lambda$.

We can construct pseudolikelihoods for $\psi$ through clever choices by which to summarize $\mathcal{L}_{\psi}$ over all possible values of $\lambda$. Among the most popular methods of summary are profiling (i.e. maximization), conditioning, and integration, each with respect to the nuisance parameter. These summaries do come at a cost, however; eliminating a model's nuisance parameter from its likelihood almost always sacrifices some information about its parameter of interest as well. One measure of a good pseudolikelihood, therefore, is the balance it strikes between the amount of information it retains about $\psi$ and the ease with which it can be computed.

### The Profile Likelihood

The most straightforward method we can use to construct a pseudolikelihood (or equivalently, a pseudo-log-likelihood) function for $\psi$ is usually to find the maximum of $\ell(\theta)$ over all possible of values of $\theta$ for each value of $\psi$. This yields what is known as the *profile* log-likelihood function, formally defined as 
$$
\ell_p(\psi) = \sup_{\theta \in \Theta: \> \tau(\theta) = \psi} \ell(\theta), \> \> \psi \in \Psi.
$${#eq-2-1-1}
In the case where an explicit nuisance parameter $\lambda$ exists so that $\theta$ may be written as $\theta = (\psi, \lambda)$, @eq-2-1-1 is equivalent to replacing $\lambda$ with $\hat{\lambda}_{\psi}$, its conditional MLE given $\psi$:
$$
\ell_p(\psi) = \ell(\psi, \hat{\lambda}_{\psi}).
$${#eq-2-1-2}

Historically, the efficiency with which the profile is capable of producing accurate estimates of $\psi$ relative to its ease of computation has made it the method of choice for statisticians when performing likelihood-based inference regarding a parameter of interest. Examples of profile-based statistics are the MLE for $\psi$, i.e.,
$$
\hat{\psi} = \underset{\psi \in \Psi}{\arg\sup} \> \ell_p(\psi),
$${#eq-2-1-3}
and the signed likelihood ratio statistic for $\psi$, given by
$$
R_{\psi} = \text{sgn}(\hat{\psi} - \psi)(2(\ell_p(\hat{\psi}) - \ell_p(\psi)))^{\frac{1}{2}}.
$${#eq-2-1-4}

### The Integrated Likelihood

The *integrated likelihood* for $\psi$ seeks to summarize $\mathcal{L}_{\psi}$ by its average value with respect to some weight function $\pi$ over the space $\Theta_{\psi}$. From a theoretical standpoint, this is preferable to the maximization procedure found in the profile likelihood as it naturally incorporates our uncertainty regarding the nuisance parameter's true value into the resulting pseudolikelihood. The general form of an integrated likelihood function is given
$$
\bar{L}(\psi) = \int_{\Theta_{\psi}}L(\theta)\pi(\theta; \psi)d\theta.
$${#eq-2-2-1} 

It is up to the researcher to choose the weight function $\pi(\cdot; \psi)$, which plays an important role in the properties of the resulting integrated likelihood. Severini (2007) developed a method for re-parameterizing $\lambda$ that makes the integrated likelihood relatively insensitive to the exact weight function chosen. Using this new parameterization, we have great flexibility in choosing our weight function; as long as it does not depend on the parameter of interest, the integrated likelihood that is produced will enjoy many desirable frequency properties.
